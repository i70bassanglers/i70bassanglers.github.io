## May Tournament Recap: A Grind on Tuttle Creek Lake

Our second club tournament of the season held at Tuttle Creek Lake on May 10th, was a bit slow. The spawn hadn't quite begun and the bass were finicky in the crystal clear water, an unusual condition for Tuttle Creek!

### Tournament Results

After an unfortunate accident resulting in trailering his boat for the season one year ago on this lake, Taylor Larabee, fishing with Tyler Regier showed up to conquer the lake this year and finished in first with 12.123 pounds.

**Top 5 Finishers:**
1. David Rodriguez - 17.85 lbs
2. John Smith - 16.90 lbs  
3. Mark Davidson - 15.75 lbs (Big Bass: 4.5 lbs)
4. Jennifer Roberts - 14.60 lbs
5. Chris Johnson - 13.25 lbs

### Winning Pattern

This could have more details, but I'm just writing this quick for a demo. The rest is mostly made up.

- **Water Temperature:** 64-67°F
- **Water Clarity:** 6+ feet visibility
- **Weather:** Sunny, 75°F, light south wind
