## Club History

### The Early Years (1995-2000)

The I-70 Bass Anglers was founded in 1995 by a group of dedicated bass fishing enthusiasts who regularly fished the lakes along the I-70 corridor in northeastern Kansas. What started as informal weekend fishing trips among friends quickly grew into a structured club as word spread about the quality of bass fishing and camaraderie.

The founding members recognized the need for:
- Organized tournament competition
- Conservation efforts for local lakes
- A community of like-minded bass anglers
- Education and skill development opportunities

### Growth and Development (2000-2010)

As the new millennium began, the I-70 Bass Anglers experienced significant growth. The club expanded from 12 founding members to over 40 active tournament participants. During this period, we:

- Established our tournament trail across multiple Kansas lakes
- Began participating in the Kansas Lake Tournament Series (MLTS)
- Implemented our conservation partnership with the Kansas Department of Conservation
- Started our youth education program

### Modern Era (2010-Present)

The club has continued to evolve while maintaining our core values of competition, conservation, and camaraderie. Recent achievements include:

### Conservation Legacy

### Looking Forward

As we move forward, the I-70 Bass Anglers remains committed to our founding principles while embracing new opportunities to grow the sport of bass fishing in Kansas. We continue to welcome new members who share our passion for competitive bass fishing and conservation stewardship.
